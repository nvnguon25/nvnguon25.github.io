### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, was a favorite because not only was it the easiest lab, but it 
    introduced me to the basics of this course. Although all we had to do was 
    change a line of code to display "Hello" and then our names, it was such a 
    relief figuring out that we did it correctly even though it was so basic.

* Lab 7

   Lab 7, part 2 was a favorite because this was the first lab I had to finish at 
   home. It was fun being able to figure out how to code it without feeling 
   pressured because of the amount of time left in the class. The overall lab was 
   fun because I enjoy playing blackjack with actual cards. Once I figured out 
   how to make the code run perfectly, I had an immense amount of joy.

* Lab 10

    Lab 10, part 1 was a favorite because this lab was the most fun to do, from 
    the partner, to the actual lab. After 10 labs in, for once I felt as I knew 
    what to do compared the labs previously where I felt lost. This lab was about 
    calculating the area of a rectangle which was fairly easy (in my opinion). 
    Overall, one of my favorites from this course!
